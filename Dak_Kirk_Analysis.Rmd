## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r nflscrapR}

dak_season_data_2018 <- season_player_game(2018, Weeks=16)
kirk_season_data_2018 <- season_player_game(2018, Weeks=16)

dak_week_by_pass_yards <- dak_season_data_2018 %>% 
  filter(name == "D.Prescott")

kirk_week_by_pass_yards <- kirk_season_data_2018 %>% 
  filter(name == "K.Cousins")

p1 <- ggplot(dak_week_by_pass_yards, aes(x=dak_week_by_pass_yards$date,y=dak_week_by_pass_yards$passyds)) + geom_point() +  ggtitle("Dak's Passing Yards by Month") + xlab("2018 Season") + ylab("Passing Yards") 

p2 <- ggplot(kirk_week_by_pass_yards, aes(x=kirk_week_by_pass_yards$date, y=kirk_week_by_pass_yards$passyds)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("Kirk's Passing Yards by Month") + xlab("2018 Season") + ylab("Passing Yards")

grid.arrange(p1, p2)

```
